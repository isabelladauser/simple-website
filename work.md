## Kreuze an den Backen – Eine Ode an das Älterwerden
### Editorial design and illustrations on the subject of aging

In my final project "Kreuze an den Backen – Eine Ode an das Älterwerden" (Crosses on the Cheeks - An Ode to Aging) - I am dealing with the process of aging. What does it mean for you and others? What is really behind it? The process is made tangible and visible through stories and opinions about aging. The experiences of people from different generations are illuminated and illustrated and they are telling their own story.
